## General info
This project allows you to manage veterinary clinic. It implements entity diagram shown [below](#entity-relationship-diagram). This application allows a user to manage information about:
* employees and their positions (e.g. doctor, secretary, technician)
* facilities and offices
* patients and their species
* owners and organizations
* appointments
* drugs
* offered services.

With this application you can schedule an appointment for a given patient - a free doctor will be automatically assigned (as well as a free office in selected facility), but it is possible to later change the assigned vet to another one on the appointment update page. Moreover <strong>Vet Clinic</strong> lets you calculate income for every facility for a given year and provides easy to access search bars on every relevant page.
